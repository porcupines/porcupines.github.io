Emergent Order LLC Token Offering
Last Updated: April 13, 2021
General Information
Emergent Order LLC (EO) has been created for the express purpose of managing donations for the acquisition of, and improvements to, real estate for the exclusive benefit of the Fraternal Order of Porcupines (FOP). All donations to EO will go directly to the acquisition of real estate, improvements of purchased real estate, operational costs associated with purchased real estate (e.g. property taxes, utility payments, maintenance/repair, business expenses, and other costs associated with the acquisition and management of real estate.) No Board Member or employee of Emergent Order LLC will receive any form of compensation derived from donations not earmarked for such purpose.

Emergent Order LLC will be issuing a fixed number of SLP tokens called “QUILL” using Bitcoin Cash (BCH) as the blockchain platform. The purpose of the QUILL token is as a tracking mechanism for EO to determine when the assets of EO will be donated to the FOP. They are not speculative instruments and there is no expectation of their rising in value. For every $1000 donated to EO, the donor will have the option of receiving one QUILL token. Accepting the transfer of one or more QUILL tokens will imply your acceptance of the “Emergent Order LLC Token Policies”, the “Emergent Order LLC Token Holder Usage Agreement”, and the “Emergent Order LLC Auction Policies”. The initial version of these policies are found in this document. These policies are subject to change at any time by the Board of Emergent Order LLC solely. The current authoritative policy can be viewed at any time at “https://emergentorder.io/EO_policies.html”.

The purpose of the QUILL token is to provide donors with an opportunity to recover their donation. At least quarterly, EO will execute a token buy back auction, the total amount to be determined by the EO Board. Additional auctions may be authorized by the EO Board. For all auctions, the method used will be a reverse auction, that is the lowest bidder(s) will win the auction. Auctions will be announced on the EO website (https://emergentorder.io) and all QUILL token holders have the opportunity to participate. Please see “Emergent Order LLC Auction Policies” for more detail.

Operations
EO will be the legal entity which purchases the real estate. FOP will pay rent to EO for the use of that real estate until such time that the FOP either purchases the assets of EO at fair market price or returns all (or a sufficient number of, as determined by the EO Board) QUILL tokens to EO. At that point, ownership of purchased real estate by EO will be donated to the FOP. Until that transfer, EO will manage the building. Rents collected will be used for taxes, maintenance, necessary improvements, or other common operational costs. Excess capital, minus a three month operating budget will be used for token buy back auctions. Once the real estate transfer is completed, the Board of EO will decide whether EO will dissolve or if it will issue a new token to support the acquisition of additional real estate for the benefit of the FOP. 

At the discretion of the EO board, the FOP may at times be offered the opportunity to pay its rent to EO using QUILL tokens.
