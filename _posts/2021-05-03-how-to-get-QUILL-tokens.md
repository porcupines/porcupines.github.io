# How do you get QUILL tokens?

It's very simple. When you donate $1000 or more to Save the Quill, you will be offered the oppountity to receive one QUILL token for each $1000 donated. There are a variety of methods to donate:

1) The Save The Quill GoFundMe page at https://www.gofundme.com/f/SaveTheQuill.
   * If you will be donating FRNs, you will need to use your real name and contact information if you want to receive tokens, as we obviously cannot determine who "Anonymous" is and prove that it was you. We will periodically review donations and one of our volunteers will contact you to make arrangements to receive your QUILL token(s), if applicable.
   * If you donate using the crypto addresses, you will need to send an email to [info@emergentorder.io](mailto:info@emergentorder.com) with the crypto you used and the transaction ID for your donation. Once the transaction is confirmed, one of our volunteers will contact you to make arrangements to receive your QUILL token(s), if applicable.

2) You can donate to EO directly. Simply send an email to [info@emergentorder.io](mailto:info@emergentorder.com) and one of our volunteers will contact you to make arrangements to accept the donation and, once received, to receive your QUILL token(s), if applicable.

3) We are in the process of setting up an EO PayPal account and will update this as soon as its ready. Upon receiving a donation, one of our volunteers will contact you to make arrangements to receive your QUILL token(s), if applicable.
